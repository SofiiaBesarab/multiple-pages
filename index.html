    <h1>Cake</h1>
    <p>
      Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients
      and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of
      bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple
      or elaborate and which share features with desserts such as pastries,
      meringues, custards, and pies.
